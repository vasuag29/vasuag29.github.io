# vasuag29.github.io

This repository contains code for my personal portfolio website.
The website is hosted on GitHub Pages from the `/docs` folder, and built via GitHub Actions.

## Projects

- `app/`: current website (modern toolchain, works on recent Node versions)
- `source/`: legacy Angular 12 implementation (kept for reference)

Feel free to fork it and use it for your own personal website!
